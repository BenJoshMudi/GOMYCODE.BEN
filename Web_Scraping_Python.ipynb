            " - A business entity is not necessarily separate from the owner and the creditors can hold the owner liable for debts the business has acquired.[citation needed]Thetaxation systemfor businesses is different from that of the corporates. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.\n",
            " - A distinction is made in law and public offices between the term business and acompanysuch as acorporationorcooperative. Colloquially, the terms are used interchangeably.\n",
            " - Corporations are distinct from withsole proprietorsandpartnerships. They are separate legal entities and providelimited liabilityfor their owners and members. They are subject tocorporate taxrates. They are also more complicated and expensive to set up, but offer more protection and benefits for the owners and members.\n",
            "Heading: Forms\n",
            " - Forms of business ownership vary byjurisdiction, but several common entities exist:\n",
            " - Less common types of companies are:\n",
            " - \"Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC (public limited company) indicates that its shares are widely held.\"[14]\n",
            " - In legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the \"members\". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be theshareholders. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Someoffshore jurisdictionshave created special forms ofoffshore companyin a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include \"segregated portfolio companies\" and restricted purpose companies.\n",
            " - There are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.\n",
            " - Companies are also sometimes distinguished intopublic companiesandprivate companiesfor legal and regulatory purposes. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on astock exchangewhich imposeslisting requirements/Listing Rulesas to the issued shares, the trading of shares and a future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.\n",
            " - Aparent companyis a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The subsidiary company can be allowed to maintain its own board of directors.[15]The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.[15]\n",

            "Heading: Accounting\n",
            " - Accounting is the measurement, processing, and communication of financial information abouteconomic entities[16][17]such as businesses andcorporations. The modern field was established by theItalianmathematicianLuca Pacioliin 1494.[18]Accounting, which has been called the \"language of business\",[19]measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, includinginvestors,creditors,management, andregulators.[20]Practitioners of accounting are known asaccountants. The terms \"accounting\" and \"financial reporting\" are often used as synonyms.\n",
            "Heading: Commerce\n",
            " - Commerce is the process of exchanging goods and services.[21]It is not just a single activity, but a set of activities that includes trade (buying and selling goods and services) and auxiliary services or aids to trade,[22]that includes communication and marketing, logistics, finance, banking, insurance, and legal services related to trade. Business is also defined as engaging in commerce, as these are done in all businesses.[23]\n",
            "Heading: Finance\n",
            " - Financeis a field that deals with the study of money andinvestments. It includes the dynamics ofassetsandliabilitiesover time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk.[24]In thecontext of business and management, finance deals with the problems of ensuring that the firm can safely and profitably carry out its operational and financial objectives; i.e. that it: (1) has sufficient cash flow for ongoing and upcoming operational expenses, and (2) can service both maturing short-term debt repayments, and scheduled long-term debt payments.\n",
            "Finance also deals with thelong termobjective of maximizing the value of the business, while also balancing risk and profitability; this includes the interrelated questions of (1)capital investment, which businesses and projects to invest in; (2)capital structure, deciding on the mix of funding to be used; and (3)dividend policy, what to do with \"excess\" capital.\n",
            "Heading: Human resources\n",
            " - Human resources can be defined as division of business that involves finding, screening,recruiting, andtrainingjob applicants.[25]Human resources, or HR, is crucial for all businesses to succeed as it helps companies adjust to a fast-moving business environment and the increasing demand for jobs.[25]\n",
            " - The term \"Human Resource\" was first coined byJohn R. Commonsin his novel 'The Distribution of Wealth'.HRdepartmentsare relatively new as they began developing in the late 20th century. HR departments main goal is to maximize employee productivity and protecting the company from any issues that may arise in the future. Some of the most common activities conducted by those working in HR include increasing innovation and creativity within a company, applying new approaches to work projects, and efficient training and communication withemployees.\n",
            " - Two of the most popular subdivisions of HR areHuman Resource Management,[26]HRM, andHuman Resource Information Systems,[27]or HRIS. The HRM route is for those who prefer anadministrativerole as it involves oversight of the entirety of the company. HRIS involves the storage and organization of employeedataincluding full names, addresses, means of contact, and anything else required by that certain company.\n",
            " - Some careers of those involved in the Human Resource field include enrollment specialists, HR analyst, recruiter, employment relations manager, etc.\n",
            "Heading: Information technology\n",
            " - Many businesses have an Information technology (IT) department, which supports the use ofinformation technologyand computer systems in support of enterprise goals. The role of aChief Information Officeris to lead this department. For example,Ford Motor Companyin the United States employs \"more than 3,000 team members with advanced computing, analytical and technical skills\".[28]\n",
            "Heading: Manufacturing\n",
            " - Manufacturingis the production ofmerchandisefor use or sale usinglabourandmachines,tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, fromhandicrafttohigh tech, but is most commonly applied toindustrialproduction, in whichraw materialsare transformed intofinished goodson a large scale.\n",
            "Heading: Marketing\n",
            " - Marketing is defined by theAmerican Marketing Associationas\"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\"[29]The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics includeadvertisingas well as determining productpricing.\n",
            " - With the rise in technology, marketing is further divided into a class calleddigital marketing. It is marketing products and services using digital technologies.\n",
            "Heading: Research and development\n",
            " - Research and development refer to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation.[30]Research and development constitute the first stage of development of a potential new service or product.[31]Research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[31]\n",
            "Heading: Safety\n",
            " - Injuries cost businesses billions of dollars annually.[32]Studies have shown how company acceptance and implementation of comprehensive safety and health management systems reduce incidents,insurancecosts, and workers' compensation claims.[33]New technologies, like wearable safety devices[34]and available online safety training, continue to be developed to encourage employers to invest in protection beyond the \"canary in the coal mine\" and reduce the cost to businesses of protecting their employees.\n",
            "Heading: Sales\n",
            " - Sales are activity related to selling or the number of goods or services sold in a given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key to a companies' success.[35]\n",
            "Heading: Management\n",
            " - The efficient and effectiveoperation of a business, and study of this subject, is calledmanagement. The major branches of management arefinancial management,marketingmanagement,human resource management,strategic management,production management,operations management,service management, andinformation technology management.[36]\n",
            " - Owners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business's value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), andhuman resources. These resources are administered in at least six functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.[citation needed]\n",
            "Heading: Restructuring state enterprises\n",
            " - In recent decades, states modeled some of theirassetsand enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example,Chinamodeled 80% of itsstate-owned enterpriseson a company-type management system.[37]Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.\n",
            "Heading: Business process management\n",
            " - Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs ofclients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can, therefore, be described as a \"process optimization process\". It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.[who?]\n",
            "Heading: Organization and regulation\n",
            " - Most legaljurisdictionsspecify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body ofcommercial lawfor each type.\n",
            " - The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:\n",
            " - Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights ofshareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded frompersonal liabilityfor the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate \"person\". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.\n",
            " - Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as asole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.\n",
            " - A few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:\n",
            "Heading: Commercial law\n",
            " - A very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade andcommerceand resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. TheCode of Hammurabidates back to about 1772 BC for example and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, toshippingcosts and dealings between merchants andbrokers.[41]The word \"corporation\" derives from the Latincorpus, meaning body, and theMaurya Empirein Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[42]\n",
            " - In many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern the treatment of labour and employee relations,worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well asunions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.\n",
            " - Some specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.\n",
            " - Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example,public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance,broadcasting,aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.\n",
            "Heading: Capital\n",
            " - When businesses need to raise money (calledcapital), they sometimes offersecuritiesfor sale.[43]\n",
            " - Capital may be raised through private means, by aninitial public offeringor IPO on astock exchange,[44]or in multiple other ways.[43]\n",
            " - Major stock exchanges include theShanghai Stock Exchange,Singapore Exchange,Hong Kong Stock Exchange,New York Stock ExchangeandNASDAQ(the US), theLondon Stock Exchange(UK), theTokyo Stock Exchange(Japan), andBombay Stock Exchange(India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.\n",
            " - Businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulatory authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\n",
            " - The proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment andlabor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.\n",
            " - Other types of capital sourcing include crowdsourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.\n",
            "Heading: Intellectual property\n",
            " - Businesses often have important \"intellectual property\" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could requirepatents,copyrights,trademarks, or preservation oftrade secrets.[45]Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to internationaltreatiesconcerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign noncompete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.\n",
            "Heading: Trade union\n",
            " - A trade union (or labor union) is anorganization of workerswho have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and betterworking conditions.[46]The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and filemembers) and negotiateslabor contracts(collective bargaining) with employers.[46]The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \"maintaining or improving the conditions of theiremployment\".[47]This may include the negotiation ofwages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing, and promotion of workers, benefits,workplace safetyand policies.\n",
